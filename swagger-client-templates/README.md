# CAF Swagger Java client template overrides

This repository contains modified versions of the standards Swagger Java client templates to enforce our logging standards.

Note that due to a regress in Swagger 3.0, all templates have to be provided and not just the overrides. Only `libraries/okhttp-gson
/ApliClient.mustache` has been modified in the 3.x directory. [(Issue tracker)](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/9893)
